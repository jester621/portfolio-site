      <h2>June 2025 - Sri Lanka Government Websites DDoS Attack</h2>
      <p>
        In June 2025, several Sri Lankan government websites, including the official <a href="https://www.gov.lk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gov.lk</a> portal and the <a href="https://www.cbsl.gov.lk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Bank of Sri Lanka</a> site, were targeted by a large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.
        Thousands of compromised devices overwhelmed these servers, causing extended downtime and disruption of online public services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The government collaborated with cybersecurity firms to mitigate the attack by deploying advanced filtering and strengthening infrastructure security.

      <h2>April 2025 - Ransomware Targeting Local Banks</h2>
      <p>
        In April 2025, a ransomware attack encrypted critical servers at major banks such as <a href="https://www.sampath.lk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sampath Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.hnb.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatton National Bank (HNB)</a>.

        The banks promptly isolated affected systems and engaged cybersecurity teams along with local authorities to handle the incident.
        This event underscored the importance of maintaining secure backups and educating staff on ransomware threats.
